A reasonably simple but bad WASM binary reader for .NET applications based off the python library [wasamole](https://github.com/CarveSystems/wasamole/) which is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/CarveSystems/wasamole/blob/master/LICENSE)


## Info
Some parts might be broken, this started as a rewrite of an older and hence some sections aren't implemented for viewing or editing, namely Elem, Start and Table section. I plan on finishing it eventually but until then it'll have to stay like that

Code section writing is broken and therefore is commented out as well


## Example
You can check the console program in this repo for an example
